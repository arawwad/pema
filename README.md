### notes
task involved making business logic and user experience which shouldn't be really my job to do but I went with my guesses and experience

of course the task is very minimal cause of the time limit

if I had more time I think I would have spent it more on styling every thing and add more logic to the direction Api
it works only for the first chosen customer only.
